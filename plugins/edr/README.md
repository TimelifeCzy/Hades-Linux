THIS IS INSPIRED BY cilium/tetragon, but we won't handle this in a complex way, just as easy as we could. And I do not intend to make **edriver** as an all-in-one plugin, as it would be way too complex to maintain.


## QUESTIONS

1. ~~Why Rust?~~

    ~~Nothing special. This would be easier if we use golang since edriver is already finished. Just want to try things differently, which means we may trans to golang if the libs of rust is not as good as we want.~~

    Not as convinient as I expected. It seems I always get problems loading the bytecode compile from clang. ISSUES like https://github.com/foniod/redbpf/issues/353.

2. What the features?

    Several basic features which, I think, would be useful in real world. Detection is NOT the purpose of this plugin.

    1. Network restriction both in Host-based and process-based.
    2. File access restriction like /etc/passwd.
    3. (Future) BPF/LKM load pre checker

## TIPS

1. Find override whitelist

    `cat /proc/kallsyms | grep _eil_addr`
